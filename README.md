# Unit 19 React: Employee Directory

![Employee Directory Screenshot](./public/screen.png?raw=true "employee directory")

## Overview

This is an employee directory created with React. It breaks up the application's UI into components, manages component state, and responds to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
