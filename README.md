## Overview

This is a informational directory created with React. It breaks up the application's UI into components, manages component state, and responds to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view the entire directory at once so that I have quick access to information.

## Business Context

An associate or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other associates. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter people by name.

## Criteria

When the user loads the page, a table of associates should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the associates by at least one property.

## Technologies Used

CSS: Bootstrap
